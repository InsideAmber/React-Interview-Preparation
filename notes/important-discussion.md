✅ **When Does useEffect(() => {}, []) Actually Run Again?**

It will rerun only if:

- The component is unmounted and remounted (e.g., route navigation or conditional rendering).

- You intentionally re-render the whole component by changing its key or by wrapping it in a parent that remounts.

- React Strict Mode (in dev) may cause double invocation of effects for development-only checks (not in production).

| Case                              | Will useEffect with `[]` run again?  |
| --------------------------------- | -----------------------------------  |
| Initial mount                     | ✅ Yes                               |
| State update                      | ❌ No                                |
| Event triggered (e.g., `onClick`) | ❌ No                                |
| Parent re-renders                 | ❌ No                                |
| Component unmounted and remounted | ✅ Yes                               |
| React Strict Mode (dev only)      | ✅ Twice (but only in dev)           |

✅ **When does a Functional Component Re-render?**

A functional component re-renders when:

- Its own state changes (`useState`)

- Its props change

- Its parent re-renders and it’s not memoized (like with `React.memo`)

So, if you're clicking a button that updates count using useState, that will trigger a re-render of your component.

✅ **What happens during a Re-render?**

Every function inside the component body is re-executed during a re-render.
That means:

- JSX is recalculated.

- All variables and functions declared inside the component are recreated.

- Side effects (`useEffect`) are checked against dependencies and re-run only if needed.

Example:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // This function runs on **every re-render**
  const getEvenSum = () => {
    console.log("Calculating sum...");
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
      sum += i;
    }
    return sum;
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <p>Even Sum (0 to 10): {getEvenSum()}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

What happens here:

When you click "Increment":

- count updates.

- Component re-renders.

- `getEvenSum()` is called again and "Calculating sum..." is logged again.

🔧 How to Prevent Unnecessary Calculations

If you don't want to run expensive functions again unless needed, use:

✅ `useMemo`

```jsx
const evenSum = useMemo(() => {
  console.log("Calculating sum...");
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
    sum += i;
  }
  return sum;
}, []); // runs only once
```
Or:

✅ `useCallback` (for memoizing functions)

| Concept                      | Does it trigger re-render? | Does it run again on re-render?        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------  |
| `useState` update            | ✅ Yes                    | ✅ Whole component runs again          |
| Function inside component    | —                          | ✅ Recreated and re-run                |
| Expensive calc inside render | —                          | ✅ Runs again unless memoized          |
| `useMemo`                    | —                          | ❌ Only re-runs if dependencies change |


🔄 **Why are functions inside components re-run on re-render?**

Because React functional components are just functions.

When a React component re-renders, it is literally re-executed from the top like a regular function:

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  // Everything here runs again on re-render
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const getEvenSum = () => {
    // This function is recreated every time
  };

  return (...);
}
```

So yes — functions, variables, and JSX inside the component are all recalculated when the component re-renders.

🤔 Is this a drawback?
It can be, but it's also a tradeoff React makes for simplicity and consistency:

✅ Advantages:

- Predictable behavior: everything inside the component depends only on the current state/props.

- Easier to reason about: no partial state or stale data.

- No need to manage lifecycle methods manually like in class components.

⚠️ Drawback:

- Performance: if you're doing expensive calculations or creating large objects/functions inside the component, these get recreated unnecessarily.

🔐 Solution: React gives us tools to optimize

React assumes most functions are lightweight, but when they’re not, you can optimize them:

1. ✅ useMemo

Memoize expensive values:

```jsx
const evenSum = useMemo(() => getEvenSum(), []);
```

2. ✅ useCallback

Memoize functions to avoid re-creating them:

```jsx
const getEvenSum = useCallback(() => {
  // logic here
}, []);
```

3. ✅ React.memo

Memoize entire components if props/state don't change:

```jsx
const Child = React.memo(({ data }) => {
  // won't re-render unless 'data' changes
});
```

✅ **What Happens on Re-render in Class Components?**

When a class component re-renders:

- The render() method runs again.

- But other parts like methods, instance variables, and even the constructor do NOT run again.

🔁 Class Component Behavior Example:

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
    console.log("🔁 Constructor runs only once");
  }

  getEvenSum = () => {
    console.log("✅ getEvenSum is reused — not recreated");
    return [2, 4, 6].reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  };

  render() {
    console.log("⚡ render runs on every re-render");
    const sum = this.getEvenSum();

    return (
      <div>
        <p>Sum: {sum}</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Increment
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

✅ Summary of Execution:

| Method / Property   | When it Runs                |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `constructor`       | Once, when component mounts |
| `getEvenSum` method | Created once, reused        |
| `render()`          | Runs on **every** re-render |
| `setState()`        | Triggers re-render          |


So you’re right — class components reuse their methods and properties, which can be more performance-friendly in some scenarios.

**So Why Did React Push Functional Components Then?**

Functional components with hooks:

- Are more concise

- Remove confusing lifecycles (like `componentDidMount` vs `componentWillReceiveProps`)

- Fit better with modern JavaScript (closures, functional style)

- Allow custom hook abstraction (very powerful)

Even though they re-run everything, React is optimized internally to keep things fast. And if needed, we optimize using `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `React.memo`, etc.
