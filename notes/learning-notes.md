## 1. What is the Virtual DOM and how does React use it?
- The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM.
- React uses the VDOM to improve performance. When your app changes state:
- React creates a new Virtual DOM.
- It compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one (diffing).
- Then, React applies only the minimal updates to the real DOM (aka reconciliation).
  ### Why it‚Äôs important:
    - Real DOM manipulations are slow.
    - VDOM makes UI updates efficient and fast.

## 2. What are the differences between functional and class components?

| Feature           | Class Component                  | Functional Component    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Syntax            | ES6 class                        | JavaScript function     |
| State             | `this.state` + `this.setState()` | `useState` hook         |
| Lifecycle methods | Yes                              | Via hooks (`useEffect`) |
| `this` context    | Required                         | Not needed              |
| Cleaner code      | ‚ùå Often more boilerplate        |‚úÖ Concise and readable |

## 3. Explain the Component Lifecycle in React

‚úÖ Lifecycle Phases (Class Components):

Mounting: Component is added to DOM
- `constructor()`, `render()`, `componentDidMount()`

Updating: Props/state changes
- `shouldComponentUpdate()`, `componentDidUpdate()`

Unmounting: Component is removed
- `componentWillUnmount()`

‚úÖ Diagram:

Mounting ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Updating ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Unmounting
    ‚Üì             ‚Üë
componentDidMount  componentDidUpdate

How do Lifecycle Methods Map to Hooks?

| Class Lifecycle Method | Equivalent Hook                           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `componentDidMount`    | `useEffect(() => {}, [])`                 |
| `componentDidUpdate`   | `useEffect(() => { ... }, [deps])`        |
| `componentWillUnmount` | `useEffect(() => return () => {...}, [])` |

## 4. What is JSX? Can the browser read JSX directly?

‚úÖ Concept:
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that lets you write HTML in JavaScript.

It looks like HTML but is actually syntactic sugar for `React.createElement()`.

‚ùó Important:
- JSX is not valid JavaScript.
- It must be transpiled (compiled) using Babel or a bundler like Vite, Webpack.

‚úÖ JSX Example:
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, Mr. Amber</h1>;
```

Transpiled version:
```js
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, Mr. Amber');
```

‚úÖ Browser:
The browser doesn't understand JSX, but your build tools convert it to plain JavaScript.


## 5. Props vs State ‚Äì Key Differences

| Feature      | Props                  | State                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Mutability   | Immutable (read-only)  | Mutable (can change)  |
| Managed by   | Parent component       | The component itself  |
| Use case     | Data passing           | Dynamic data handling |
| Access in TS | Through interface/type | `useState` hook       |

  ### State Updates are Asynchronous

   ```tsx
   setCount(count + 1);
   console.log(count); // Might still show old value!
   ```

  - React batches multiple state updates for performance optimization. 
  - Always use the functional update form if you're updating based on previous state:

   ```tsx
   setCount(prev => prev + 1);
   ```

## 6. üîÅ Mutability vs Immutability
  
|   Concept      | Mutability                        | Immutability                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | Changing the original object/data | Creating a new copy instead of modifying |
| **Example**    | `array.push(4)`                   | `[...array, 4]`                          |
| **Impact**     | React might not detect changes    | React detects new object ‚Üí re-renders    |

Example 1 ‚Äî ‚ùå Mutable Update (Incorrect)

```tsx
const [numbers, setNumbers] = useState([1, 2, 3]);

const addNumber = () => {
  numbers.push(4); // ‚ùå modifies the original array
  setNumbers(numbers); // React doesn't detect change
};
```
Why this fails:
- numbers is mutated with `.push()`
- You set the same reference back with `setNumbers(numbers)`
- React checks object reference ‚Üí sees it's the same ‚Üí no re-render happens

Example 2 ‚Äî Immutable Update (Correct) :

```tsx
const [numbers, setNumbers] = useState([1, 2, 3]);

const addNumber = () => {
  setNumbers(prev => [...prev, 4]); // ‚úÖ creates a new array
};
```
Why this works:
- `prev` is untouched
- `[...prev, 4]` creates a new array
- New reference triggers React's diffing ‚Üí triggers re-render

üîç Visualizing with Object References:

```tsx
const a = [1, 2, 3];
const b = a;        // mutable ‚Äî same reference
const c = [...a];   // immutable ‚Äî new reference
```

Mutability means modifying the original data structure, while immutability involves creating a new copy with changes. React‚Äôs useState depends on immutability ‚Äî it only re-renders when state changes via a new reference. Mutating state directly can cause React to skip updates.


## 7. What is Code Splitting?
Code splitting is a technique to break your JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks so that only the code needed for a particular route/component is loaded ‚Äî not the entire app upfront.

It helps:
- ‚è± Reduce initial load time
- üì∂ Improve performance on slow networks
- üì± Make large apps feel faster and more responsive

How React Supports Code Splitting?

Using:
```tsx
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./YourComponent"));
```
This loads the component only when needed. You then wrap it in:

```tsx
<Suspense fallback={<Loader />}>
  <LazyComponent />
</Suspense>
```
| Feature          | Benefit                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `React.lazy()`   | Lazily loads components                |
| `Suspense`       | Displays fallback UI while loading     |
| Split by route   | Loads only what‚Äôs needed when needed   |
| Production build | Uses `vite` to split into actual files |

My observation -
- When you refresh the page, only the main bundle is loaded.
- When you visit a lazy-loaded route, a new JS file (chunk) is loaded in the Network tab.

That‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs supposed to happen with lazy loading + code splitting!

Initial Load:
- React loads only what's immediately needed (e.g. Home.tsx, layout, nav).
- It doesn‚Äôt include DashboardPage.tsx or any other lazy-loaded components.
- So your initial bundle is smaller and loads faster.

When Route is Visited:
- When user navigates to /dashboard, React:
  - Fetches DashboardPage.tsx on demand
  - Shows <Loader /> fallback during fetch
  - Then renders the component

## 8. How would you debug unnecessary re-renders?

1. Use [React DevTools Profiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools):
    
   Tool: React Developer Tools Extension (Chrome/Firefox)
   
   - Go to Profiler tab
   - Click ‚ÄúRecord‚Äù üü•
   - Interact with your UI
   - Stop recording üü¶

   What it shows:
  
   - Which components rendered
   - How long they took
   - Why they re-rendered (e.g. props changed or not)

   Use it to spot:
  
   - Components re-rendering without props/state change
   - Frequent re-renders in lists

2. Add `console.log()` Inside Components
   
   ```tsx
   console.log("üîÅ Re-rendering MyComponent");
   ```
   - Simple but effective
   - Helps pinpoint if child components re-render unnecessarily

3. Use `React.memo`/`PureComponent` with Logs

    ```tsx
    const MyComponent = React.memo((props) => {
    console.log("üîÅ Memoized Component rendered");
    return <div>{props.value}</div>;
    });
    ```

    - If logs appear despite no prop change, there's a problem

4. Track Object/Array Identity

    Common Mistake:
     Passing a new object or array on every render:
     
     ```tsx
      <MyComponent someProp={{ x: 1 }} /> // Always new object ‚Üí re-renders
     ```

    Fix:
     Use `useMemo` or `useCallback` to memoize:
   
     ```tsx
      const memoizedObj = useMemo(() => ({ x: 1 }), []);
     ```

5. Add `why-did-you-render` Library
   
    Helps highlight unnecessary renders during development
      Setup:
  
     ```tsx
        npm install @welldone-software/why-did-you-render
     ```
    
     ```tsx
        import React from "react";
        if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
        // @ts-ignore
        import("why-did-you-render").then((whyDidYouRender) => {
          whyDidYouRender.default(React, {
            trackAllPureComponents: true,
          });
        });
        }
     ```
     Now if a React.memo component re-renders without prop change, it logs a warning.

6. Avoid Inline Functions in JSX (if passed to child)

     ```tsx
      <MyComponent onClick={() => doSomething()} /> // Triggers re-render every time
     ```
     Instead:

     ```tsx
      const onClick = useCallback(() => doSomething(), []);
      <MyComponent onClick={onClick} />
     ```

7. Break Down Big Components:

  If a component has:
   - Many props
   - Deep conditional logic
   - Lists or DOM manipulations

  Split it into smaller components and use React.memo to isolate re-renders.

  Summary Table

  | Tool / Strategy                | Purpose                                |
  | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
  | **React Profiler**             | Visualize rendering frequency/time     |
  | **Console logs**               | Simple tracking of renders             |
  | **React.memo / PureComponent** | Prevents re-renders on unchanged props |
  | **useMemo / useCallback**      | Avoids prop identity changes           |
  | **why-did-you-render**         | Warns about avoidable re-renders       |
  | **Component breakdown**        | Limits re-render scope                 |

  You Can also Create a `useRenderCount()` Hook

  To track how often a component renders:
  ```tsx
  import { useRef } from "react";

  export function useRenderCount(name: string) {
  const renderCount = useRef(1);
  console.log(`üîÅ ${name} rendered ${renderCount.current++} times`);
  }
  ```
  usage:
  ```tsx
  useRenderCount("MyComponent");
  ```
## 9. What are the key differences between SSR and CSR in React ?

The Core Difference

It all comes down to where your React app‚Äôs HTML is generated:

| Feature                   | **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**                         | **CSR (Client-Side Rendering)**                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HTML generation**       | Happens **on the server** before sending to the browser | Happens **in the browser** after downloading JavaScript   |
| **First content load**    | HTML is ready immediately ‚Üí faster first paint          | Browser sees almost empty HTML ‚Üí waits for JS to build UI |
| **SEO**                   | Better for SEO ‚Äî search engines see full HTML           | Worse for SEO if not handled, as bots may see blank HTML  |
| **Initial load speed**    | Usually faster for content-heavy pages                  | Slower initially (due to JS download & render)            |
| **Subsequent navigation** | May require full or partial server trips                | Instant after initial load (SPA behavior)                 |

How They Work

**CSR Flow (Client-Side Rendering)**

- Browser requests the page ‚Üí gets a bare HTML file with a `<div id="root"></div>`.

- React JS bundle downloads.

- React runs in the browser and builds the UI inside `<div id="root">`.

- User sees content after JS finishes execution.

Example:

A typical Create React App setup.

**SSR Flow (Server-Side Rendering)**

Browser requests the page ‚Üí server runs React code and returns full HTML.

User sees content immediately (before JS).

JS bundle downloads ‚Üí React hydrates the HTML to make it interactive.

Subsequent navigation may behave like a SPA (if using frameworks like Next.js).

Example:

Next.js `getServerSideProps` or frameworks like Remix.

**Pros & Cons**

Client-Side Rendering

‚úÖ Pros:

- Great for dynamic, interactive applications.

- Reduced server load (server mostly just sends static files).

- Fast navigation after first load (SPA experience).

‚ùå Cons:

- Slower first content paint (bad for low-bandwidth devices).

- Poor SEO unless pre-rendering or SSR is added.

- Users may see a "blank screen" until JS loads.

Server-Side Rendering

‚úÖ Pros:

- Faster first paint (HTML is ready on arrival).

- Great for SEO (HTML has content for crawlers).

-Better for slow devices (less JS to execute initially).

‚ùå Cons:

- More server load (server generates HTML for every request).

- Complex to set up compared to CSR.

- Navigation between pages might not be as fast without client-side routing.

**When to Use Which?**

| Use SSR When‚Ä¶                                           | Use CSR When‚Ä¶                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEO is critical (blogs, e-commerce, news sites).        | SEO isn‚Äôt critical (internal dashboards, tools).         |
| Users should see content instantly.                     | App is highly interactive and user-driven.               |
| Content is static or semi-static but needs to be fresh. | You want a pure SPA experience with minimal server work. |

Visual Diagram:

```js
--- SSR ---
Browser ‚Üí Server ‚Üí [HTML + minimal JS] ‚Üí Show content ‚Üí Hydrate ‚Üí Interactive

--- CSR ---
Browser ‚Üí Server ‚Üí [Empty HTML + JS] ‚Üí Load JS ‚Üí Render in browser ‚Üí Interactive
```

## 10. What is cookies and how to implement in reactjs?

1. Cookies

- A cookie is a small piece of data stored in the browser, sent by the server.

- Typically used to store:

  - Session ID (reference to a logged-in user session on the server)

  - Small preferences (language, theme, etc.)

- Cookies can be:

  - HTTP-only: not accessible from JS (more secure, used for authentication).

  - Secure: sent only over HTTPS.

  - SameSite: restricts cross-site requests to prevent CSRF.

üëâ Example: After login, backend sets:

```bash

Set-Cookie: sessionId=abcd1234; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict

```
2. Session

- A session is a server-side storage mechanism that stores user-specific data.

- Session data is linked to a cookie (usually a `sessionId`).

- Instead of storing sensitive data in the browser, only the session ID is stored in a cookie, and the server holds all actual data (like user ID, roles, cart, etc.).

üëâ Flow:

- User logs in ‚Üí server validates ‚Üí creates a session in DB/Memory/Redis.

- Server sets cookie (`sessionId=xyz`) in browser.

- On every request, browser automatically sends the cookie.

- Server reads the session ID ‚Üí fetches data ‚Üí identifies the user.

3. Implementing in React

Case 1: Using Cookie-based Auth (HTTP-only secure cookie)

Here React doesn‚Äôt touch the cookie directly, the browser sends it automatically.

Login Request (React code):

```tsx
// pages/Login.tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const Login = () => {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
  const [password, setPassword] = useState("");

  const handleLogin = async () => {
    const res = await fetch("https://api.mybank.com/login", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      credentials: "include", // <-- Important: include cookies
      body: JSON.stringify({ email, password }),
    });

    if (res.ok) {
      alert("Login successful!");
    } else {
      alert("Invalid credentials");
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input value={email} onChange={e => setEmail(e.target.value)} />
      <input type="password" value={password} onChange={e => setPassword(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Login;
```
Here:

- `credentials: "include"` ‚Üí tells React fetch to include cookies.

- Backend sets `Set-Cookie` header with `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict`.

- Browser stores it and automatically attaches it on every request.

Fetching user data after login:

```tsx
const getProfile = async () => {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.mybank.com/profile", {
    method: "GET",
    credentials: "include",
  });
  const data = await res.json();
  console.log(data);
};
```
Case 2: Using Session-like Token (JWT in Cookie or LocalStorage)

Some apps store a JWT (JSON Web Token) instead of server sessions.

- Backend returns `accessToken` after login.

- React stores it either in:

  - HttpOnly cookie (recommended) ‚Üí browser auto-sends it.

  - `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` (less secure, but easier).

Example (JWT in localStorage):

```tsx
localStorage.setItem("token", token);

// later in requests
fetch("/api/data", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem("token")}`
  }
});
```
4. Which is better?

- For fintech, banking, or secure apps ‚Üí Use HttpOnly secure cookies + server sessions.
(Frontend can‚Äôt read the cookie, attacker scripts can‚Äôt steal it ‚Üí prevents XSS token theft).

- For general apps ‚Üí JWT in localStorage is common, but needs extra protection against XSS.

Summary:

- Cookies = client-side storage (small, auto-sent by browser).

- Sessions = server-side storage of user data, identified via cookies.

- React implementation = Usually just `fetch` with `credentials: "include"`, backend manages sessions with cookies.

‚ö° So how does backend know it‚Äôs you?

Because the cookie value (session ID / JWT) is like a "ticket".

- When you first logged in with credentials (email+password), backend issued the ticket (cookie).

- After that, you don‚Äôt need to send email/password each time. The browser just replays the ticket.

- Backend validates the ticket against its session store or JWT signature.

üëâ Think of it like this analogy:

- At the gate (login), you show ID proof (username/password).

- Security gives you a visitor badge (session cookie).

- Every time you re-enter, you just flash the badge (cookie).

- Security already knows who you are by looking up the badge number (session lookup).

Example request/response flow

Login request (with email/password):

```js
POST /login
Content-Type: application/json

{ "email": "amber@test.com", "password": "12345" }
```
Login response (server sets cookie):

```js
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Set-Cookie: sessionId=xyz987; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict
```
Next request from React with `credentials: "include"`:

```js
GET /profile
Cookie: sessionId=xyz987
```
Backend logic (pseudo-code):

```js
app.get("/profile", (req, res) => {
  const sessionId = req.cookies.sessionId;
  const session = db.sessions.find(s => s.id === sessionId);

  if (!session) return res.status(401).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });

  const user = db.users.find(u => u.id === session.userId);
  res.json({ email: user.email, name: user.name });
});
```
Answer in short:

`credentials: "include"` ensures the browser sends cookies with the request. Those cookies contain a session ID (or token) that the backend previously issued at login. The backend uses that session ID to look up the actual user.
